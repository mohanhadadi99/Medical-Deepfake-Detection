deteCT: A Comprehensive medical deepfake detection.

The project was implemented on Ct scans of the lungs.
The dataset consisted of 6k images classified into four classes(TM,FM,TB,TM) which are Augumented by CT-GAN.
The dataset is not based on the full ct scan of the lung but it mainly focuses on the cancer module part where the ct gan has a scope to tamper it.

The dataset was preprocessed and split into training,testing and validation.

A 3d-CNN was built for the purpose of training and testing.

for the front end Streamlit was used. A user friendly interface was built.
